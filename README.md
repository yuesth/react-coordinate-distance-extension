# React Coordinate Distance Calculator

This package using Haversine formula in order to measure distance between two or more coordinate points:

$$a = \(\text{sin}^{2}(\frac{\Delta \text{lat}}{2})\) + \(\text{cos}(\text{lat}_{1})\cdot \text{cos}(\text{lat}_{2})\cdot \text{sin}^{2}(\frac{\Delta \text{lon}}{2})\)$$

Formed as Webpack-based modularization package that good to accomodate as your chrome extension.
