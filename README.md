# React Coordinate Distance Calculator

This package using Haversine formula in order to measure distance between two or more coordinate points:

$$a = \(\text{sin}^{2}(\frac{\Delta \text{lat}}{2})\) + \(\text{cos}(\text{lat}_{1})\cdot \text{cos}(\text{lat}_{2})\cdot \text{sin}^{2}(\frac{\Delta \text{lon}}{2})\)$$

Formed as Webpack-based modularization package that good to accomodate as your chrome extension.

## Use in Your Own Local

1. Clone this repo
2. Open your Google Chrome extension setting, then load **dist** file from cloned repo.
3. Restart and you can easily check distance between 2 or more coordinate based on longitude and latitude.
